        1. What is personal information
      </h4>
      <p className="my-2">
        “Personal information” has the meaning given in the Privacy Act. It
        includes any information or opinion about an identified individual, or
        an individual who is reasonably identifiable, whether true or not, and
        whether recorded in a material form or not.
      </p>

          personal information from children. If you are under 18, parental or
          guardian consent is required before submitting a request.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="my-2">
        We only collect information that is reasonably necessary for our
        functions, and we take steps to ensure it is accurate, complete, and up
        to date.

      <h4 className="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        3. How we collect your information
      </h4>
      <p className="my-2">
        We collect personal information directly from you when you:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 my-2 space-y-1">
        <li>Submit the quote request form.</li>
        <li>
          Communicate with us, estate developers, or builders through the tool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Interact with the embedded website tool (cookies, analytics, technical
          logs).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="my-2">We may also receive information indirectly from:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 my-2 space-y-1">
        <li>Estate developers (lot details and status).</li>
        <li>Builders (updates on quotes generated).</li>
        <li>Service providers (analytics, hosting, support logs).</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="my-2">
        You can choose not to provide information, but if you do, we may be
        unable to generate a quote or respond effectively to your enquiry.
      </p>

      <h4 className="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        4. Purposes of collection and use
      </h4>
      <p className="my-2">
        We collect, hold, and use your personal information to:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 my-2 space-y-1">
        <li>Generate and deliver builder quotes based on your preferences.</li>
        <li>
          Share your details with estate developers and their authorised sales
          teams so they can respond to your enquiry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Share your details with selected builders so they can prepare and
          deliver quotes.
        </li>
        <li>Maintain records, monitor quality, and improve our services.</li>
        <li>Conduct analytics, testing, and development of the tool.</li>
        <li>
          Send marketing communications if you have opted in (with clear opt-out
          at any time).
        </li>
        <li>Meet our legal and regulatory obligations.</li>
        <li>
          Manage risks, conduct audits, and run privacy impact assessments where
          required.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="my-2">
        <strong>Trusted builders</strong> means third-party building companies
        that have been approved by the estate developer or BlockPlanner to
        participate in the quoting process. These builders are independent
        organisations. They receive your details only for the purpose of
        preparing and delivering a quote and are expected to handle your
        personal information in accordance with Australian privacy law.
      </p>

      <h4 className="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Automated decision-making</h4>
      <p className="my-2">BlockPlanner may use algorithms to assist with:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 my-2 space-y-1">
        <li>Filtering plans and lots according to your stated preferences.</li>
        <li>Suggesting or prioritising builders for matching.</li>
        <li>Generating indicative cost ranges.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="my-2">
        These tools do not make final binding decisions. Builders and estate
        developers always review and issue the final quote. If an automated
        process materially influences the quote you receive, you can request
        human review.
      </p>

      <h4 className="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6. Disclosure of information</h4>
      <p className="my-2">We may disclose your information to:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 my-2 space-y-1">
        <li>Estate developers hosting the tool and their sales teams.</li>
        <li>
          Builder companies you select (or that are matched based on your
          preferences) and their authorised representatives.
        </li>
        <li>
          Third-party service providers that support our operations (hosting,
          analytics, IT security, communications platforms).
        </li>
        <li>
          Professional advisers, insurers, or regulators where required by law.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="my-2">
        <strong>Cross-border disclosure</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="my-2">
        Some of our service providers store or process data outside Australia.
        These may include the United States, Singapore, and the European Union.
        We take reasonable steps to ensure that overseas recipients comply with
        obligations substantially similar to Australian privacy law.

      <h4 className="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        7. Storage, security, and retention
      </h4>
